Here is an enhanced version of the Logger.cs file, following the specified goals and best practices:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

namespace LoggingService
{
    public interface ILogger
    {
        void LogMessage(string message);
    }

    public class Logger : ILogger
    {
        private readonly string _filePath;
        private static readonly object _lock = new object();

        public Logger(string logFilePath = "log.txt")
        {
            _filePath = logFilePath;
        }

        public void LogMessage(string message)
        {
            try
            {
                lock (_lock)
                {
                    using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(_filePath, true))
                    {
                        writer.WriteLine($"{DateTime.Now}: {message}");
                    }
                }
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                // Handling the exception. You might want to notify somewhere more appropriately.
                Console.Error.WriteLine("Failed to log message: " + ex.Message);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Modifications:

1. **Interface Implementation (ILogger):**
   - Adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle part of SOLID. It abstracts the Logger implementation allowing easy substitution or mock implementation for testing, and enabling the actual logging mechanics to differ without changing the dependent code.

2. **Constructor Injection for File Path:**
   - Increases modularity by allowing the file path to be specified at runtime. Defaults to "log.txt" if not provided.

3. **Safe Multithreading with a Lock:**
   - Ensures that the logger is thread-safe by locking the write operation. This is important in a multi-threaded application to prevent file access conflicts and ensure the log messages aren't mangled.

4. **Using Block:**
   - Automatically handles the opening and closing of the StreamWriter, which is crucial for resource management and prevents memory leaks.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Broadens robustness by catching any exceptions that might occur during the logging process (for example, if the file cannot be accessed). Errors in logging should not interfere with the business functionalities.

6. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Using 'StreamWriter' with append mode (`true` in constructor) avoids rewriting the entire file each time and enhances performance with potentially large log files. 

7. **Security Practices:**
   - Simple in this context but ensuring exclusive file access during write operations is a primary method. In more sensitive environments, considerations about where and how logs are written (e.g., file permissions, encryption) should be addressed.

8. **Additional Improvements in Logging Information:**
   - Including a timestamp in the log provides better traceability of when events have occurred. This is essential for diagnosing issues post-factum.

This version of the Logger class is more robust, reusable, and compliant with good programming practices, providing a foundation for further extensions such as different output destinations (e.g., database, network), log formatting, and severity levels.
