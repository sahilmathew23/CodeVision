### Enhanced version of `DataHandler.cs`
```csharp
using System;

namespace InputProcessor
{
    public interface IDataProcessor
    {
        int ProcessData();
    }

    public class DataHandler : IDataProcessor
    {
        private readonly int num1 = 10;
        private readonly int num2 = 20;

        public int ProcessData()
        {
            try
            {
                var result = CalculateResult(num1, num2);
                Console.WriteLine("Processing Data...");
                LogResult(result);
                return result;
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.Error.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
                throw; // Rethrow to allow further error handling up the call stack
            }
        }

        private int CalculateResult(int operand1, int operand2)
        {
            return operand1 + operand2;
        }

        private void LogResult(int result)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Calculated Result: {result}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Modifications

1. **Interface `IDataProcessor`**:
    - Implemented an interface `IDataProcessor` for the `DataHandler` class promoting the Dependency Inversion Principle of SOLID and enhancing modularity and reusability. 
    - Having this interface allows for easier mocking and testing and interchangeability of different data processors if the need arises in the future.

2. **Removal of unused and unnecessary components**:
    - Removed the large unused `dataArray` which was wasting memory resources.
    - Removed the excessive loop (100,000 iterations only printing a string), as it unnecessarily consumed CPU cycles and extended runtime without serving any practical data processing function.

3. **Encapsulation and Access Modifiers**:
    - Changed `num1` and `num2` to `readonly` since they are not modified outside of their initial declaration. This ensures the class is safer and variables are not inadvertently changed.

4. **Error Handling**:
    - Added a try-catch block in `ProcessData()` to capture and log any exceptions. This promotes robustness and makes the module more secure and reliable.
    - The exception is rethrown after logging to handle it appropriately at a higher level, potentially allowing for better recovery from errors or appropriate user notifications.

5. **Logging**:
    - Extracted logging into a method `LogResult()`. This keeps the logging logic separate from the primary functionality, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

6. **Performance Consideration**:
    - By removing the unused large array and unnecessary computational loop, both memory and CPU are better utilized leading to performance improvements.

7. **Security and Reliability**:
    - While the base version doesn't introduce direct security flaws due to lack of external interactions like file accesses or network calls, the addition of structured error handling raises reliability against unexpected runtime exceptions.

The revised structure of `DataHandler` leads to a cleaner, more maintainable, and potentially testable structure, adhering to many of the SOLID principles, and it prepares the code better for future expansions and modifications.
