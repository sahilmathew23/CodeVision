### Enhanced Version of `UserManager.cs`

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace UserManagement
{
    public interface IUserManager
    {
        string GetUser(int index);
        List<string> GetAllUsers();
    }

    public class UserManager : IUserManager
    {
        private readonly List<string> _users;
        private readonly ILogger<UserManager> _logger;

        public UserManager(ILogger<UserManager> logger)
        {
            _users = new List<string> { "Alice", "Bob" };
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public string GetUser(int index)
        {
            if (index < 0 || index >= _users.Count)
            {
                _logger.LogWarning("Attempted to access an index out of bounds: {Index}", index);
                return null; // Safely returns null if the index is out of range
            }
            _logger.LogInformation("Fetching user at index {Index}", index);
            return _users[index];
        }

        public List<string> GetAllUsers()
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("Fetching all users");
            return new List<string>(_users);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Modifications

1. **SOLID Principles Compliance:**
   - **Single Responsibility Principle:** `UserManager` solely manages user storage and retrieval. Logging is delegated to a supplied logger.
   - **Open/Closed Principle:** Extended functionality can be added by implementing more interfaces without modifying existing code.
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle:** `UserManager` implements the `IUserManager` interface, allowing it to be replaced with other implementations of `IUserManager` without affecting the integrity of the application.
   - **Interface Segregation:** The `IUserManager` interface ensures that `UserManager` only exposes necessary methods, promoting a clean contract.
   - **Dependency Inversion:** `UserManager` depends on abstractions (`ILogger` and `IUserManager`) rather than concrete implementations, increasing flexibility and ease of testing.

2. **Modularity and Reusability:** 
   - The `IUserManager` interface promotes modularity, allowing different implementations of user management strategies within the same application or across different applications without changing the consuming logic.

3. **Performance and Scalability:**
   - `GetAllUsers` method returns a new list instead of a reference to the private `_users`, preventing consumers from modifying the internal state, which can be crucial as the system scales.

4. **Strengthened Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Errors, such as trying to retrieve a user at an out-of-bounds index, are logged and handled gracefully by returning `null`.
   - Use of `ILogger` for logging helps to maintain detailed logs for debugging and monitoring behaviors, crucial for troubleshooting in larger applications.

5. **Security Best Practices:**
   - Encapsulation defends class invariants by preventing external entities from altering the internal users collection directly. This aspect is pertinent for maintaining integrity and trust of the application data.

6. **.NET Coding Conventions:**
   - Follows .NET conventions, such as naming, method encapsulation, and using relevant libraries like `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`.

This revised `UserManager` provides a robust framework for managing users, adhering strictly to .NET and object-oriented design standards, facilitating ease of maintenance and extension.
