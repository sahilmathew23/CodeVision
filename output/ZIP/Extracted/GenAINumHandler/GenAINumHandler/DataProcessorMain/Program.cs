### Enhanced version of `Program.cs`

Below is an updated version of the `Program.cs` applying recommended software engineering best practices:

```csharp
using System;
using InputProcessor;
using UserManagement;
using LoggingService;

class Program
{
    private static readonly DataHandler _dataHandler = new DataHandler();
    private static readonly UserManager _userManager = new UserManager();
    private static readonly Logger _logger = new Logger();

    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting Application...");

        try
        {
            var processedData = _dataHandler.ProcessData();
            var user = _userManager.ManageUsers();

            _logger.LogMessage($"Processed Data: {processedData}, User: {user}");

            // Simulate other operations
            PerformAdditionalOperations();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogMessage($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }

    private static void PerformAdditionalOperations()
    {
        var additionalProcessedData = _dataHandler.ProcessData();
        _logger.LogMessage($"Additional Processed Data: {additionalProcessedData}");
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Modifications

1. **Refactoring to Use Singleton Objects**:
    - I declared `_dataHandler`, `_userManager`, and `_logger` as `private static readonly` fields. This avoids unnecessary instantiation every time operation is required. Hence, enhancing performance and memory management.

2. **Improving Modularity**:
    - By separating the handling of additional operations into a `PerformAdditionalOperations()` method, we increase modularity, making the codebase easier to maintain and expand.

3. **Error Handling**:
    - Wrapped the primary operations inside a `try-catch` block to improve robustness against runtime errors. Exceptions are logged, which helps with debugging issues without crashing the program.

4. **Centralized Logging**:
    - Updated the logging practice by leveraging interpolated strings, which are more readable and less prone to errors compared to concatenation. Capturing all operational logs within try/catch blocks ensures even error states are recorded.

5. **Performance**:
    - By using single instances of the handlers and loggers, the code is more efficient especially if instantiation is resource-intensive or involves network/database connections.

6. **Security and Best Practices**:
    - While the displayed refactoring does not directly address all potential security concerns (like data validation, which would happen inside the classes used), using a more robust error handling and proper logging strategy indirectly supports securing the application by ensuring that errors are recorded and could be analyzed for security-related incidents.
    - It is advisable that sensitive information should never be logged directly. This has to be assessed based on the scenarios where this application is used.

This refactored code ensures that it adheres to the SOLID principles better, focusing on single responsibility and dependency inversion indirectly by minimizing external class creation within methods and main invocation logic. Additionally, it ensures better resource management and sets a cleaner foundation for future enhancements.
