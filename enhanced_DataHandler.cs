### Enhanced Version of `DataHandler.cs`

Here is an improved version of `DataHandler.cs` that addresses the specified enhancement goals:

```csharp
using System;

namespace InputProcessor
{
    public class DataHandler
    {
        private readonly int num1 = 10;
        private readonly int num2 = 20;

        public int ProcessData()
        {
            Log("Processing Data...");
            int result = CalculateSum(num1, num2);
            Log("Calculated Result: " + result);
            return result;
        }

        private int CalculateSum(int a, int b)
        {
            return a + b;
        }

        private void Log(string message)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(message); // Replace with a more robust logging framework in production
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Modifications

1. **Refactor Using SOLID Principles:**
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** The `DataHandler` class is now solely responsible for handling data processing operations (i.e., summing two numbers and logging). The responsibilities are also split into smaller methods (`ProcessData`, `CalculateSum`, and `Log`), making the class more modular and easier to maintain.
   - **Open/Closed Principle:** Methods are designed for potential extensions or replacements of the logging mechanism, sum calculation, without altering the existing code structure. 

2. **Modularity and Reusability:**
   - **Separated Logic into Methods:** Separating the functionality into `CalculateSum` and `Log` not only makes the `DataHandler` class easier to read and maintain but also allows for reuse of these methods either within this class or potentially from other classes if accessibility changes (e.g., changing `private` to `internal`).

3. **Improve Performance and Scalability:**
   - **Removed Unused Memory Allocation:** The large unused integer array (`dataArray`) and the extensive loop that logs unnecessarily have been removed. This change significantly reduces memory consumption and the time complexity of the method when called.

4. **Strengthen Error Handling and Logging:**
   - **Basic Logging Implemented:** A simple logging method (`Log`) is created to centralize the logging logic. Replacing `Console.WriteLine` with a dedicated method allows for easier enhancements, like integrating with more sophisticated logging frameworks or adding error handling capabilities.
   - **Future Scope for Error Handling:** For more robust applications, this class could integrate exception handling mechanisms to manage and log runtime errors effectively.

5. **Security Best Practices:**
   - **Code Security:** By keeping the fields `num1` and `num2` as `readonly`, their values are fixed after initialization, reducing the risk of unintended alterations throughout the class lifecycle.
   - **Enhanced Security and Maintenance:** Future implementations could secure sensitive logging or process critical data more securely using encryption or secure data handling protocols, if necessary.

6. **.NET Coding Conventions:**
   - **Adherence to Naming and Layout Conventions:** Follows the common conventions of .NET/C# for naming (CamelCase for methods and variables) and code layout, improving readability and maintainability.
