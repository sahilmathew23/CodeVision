### Enhanced Version of `DataHandler.cs`

```csharp
using System;

namespace InputProcessor
{
    public interface IDataProcessor
    {
        int ProcessData();
    }

    public class DataHandler : IDataProcessor
    {
        private readonly int num1 = 10;
        private readonly int num2 = 20;

        public int ProcessData()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Processing Data...");
            LogData("Start Processing...");
            int result = CalculateResult(num1, num2);
            Console.WriteLine($"Calculated Result: {result}");

            LogData("Processing Completed.");
            return result;
        }

        private int CalculateResult(int number1, int number2)
        {
            try
            {
                // Check for arithmetic overflow which is unlikely in this instance but useful for larger calculations
                checked
                {
                    return number1 + number2;
                }
            }
            catch (OverflowException ex)
            {
                Console.Error.WriteLine("Error in calculation: " + ex.Message);
                throw;
            }
        }

        private void LogData(string message)
        {
            // Here we would ideally use a more robust logging framework like log4net, NLog, or Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
            Console.WriteLine(message);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Modifications

1. **Implementation of SOLID Principles**:
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: The `DataHandler` class now has clear responsibilities—processing and logging data, and handling the calculation in a separate method.
   - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: By introducing the `IDataProcessor` interface, the `DataHandler` class can be extended and modified without altering its existing code structure, facilitating easier maintenance and testing.
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Dependence on high-level abstractions (`IDataProcessor`) rather than on concretions (`DataHandler`).

2. **Modularity and Reusability**:
   - Separation into smaller methods (`CalculateResult` and `LogData`) improves readability and reusability of these methods since they can be independently modified or replaced with minimal impact on other parts of the application.

3. **Performance and Scalability**:
   - Removed the `dataArray` which was an unused large memory allocation, ensuring better use of resources especially in environments where memory is a concern.
   - Removed the redundant loop that unnecessarily printed messages to the console, potentially slowing down application performance.

4. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Added basic error handling in the `CalculateResult` to catch and log overflow errors, which helps in tracking issues related to calculation errors.
   - The method `LogData` signifies where logging occurs, which if replaced with a more sophisticated logging framework, can provide asynchronous, non-blocking logging capabilities.

5. **Adherence to .NET Coding Conventions**:
   - Employed `camelCase` for local variables and `PascalCase` for method names.
   - Used `string interpolation` for clearer and more efficient string formatting.
   - Maintained clarity in code with appropriate naming and modular structures. 

These changes align the codebase with industry-standard practices, improve the code’s maintainability, and make the application more robust against real-world scenarios by reducing memory consumption, preparing it for scalability, and ensuring proper logging and error handling mechanisms are in place.
