**Enhanced Version of `Program.cs`:**

```csharp
using System;
using InputProcessor;
using UserManagement;
using LoggingService;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting Application...");

        try
        {
            var dataHandler = new DataHandler();
            var processedData = dataHandler.ProcessData();

            var userManager = new UserManager();
            var user = userManager.ManageUsers();

            ILogger logger = new Logger();
            logger.LogMessage($"Processed Data: {processedData} User: {user}");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            ILogger logger = new Logger();
            logger.LogError("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
            Console.WriteLine("An error has occurred. Please contact support.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Modifications:**

1. **Error Handling Enhancement**:
    - Added `try-catch` blocks to catch exceptions that may occur during the execution of the data processing or user management functions. This helps prevent the application from crashing unexpectedly and provides clearer information in the case of failures.

2. **Logging and Error Reporting**:
    - Used an `ILogger` interface for logging. This promotes the use of Dependency Injection practices, making logging services easier to swap or mock when required, adhering to the **Dependency Inversion Principle**.
    - Added `LogError` in the catch block to ensure detailed error information is logged, improving the diagnosability of issues.

3. **Code Cleanliness and Reusability**:
    - Removed redundant object creation and function call `dataHandler = new DataHandler(); dataHandler.ProcessData();` as it was creating a new instance and processing data but not using the output, which can lead to performance degradation.
    
4. **Maintain .NET Coding Conventions**:
    - Amendment to `string` interpolation from concatenation as it aligns with modern .NET coding styles and improves readability.

5. **Security Best Practices**:
    - In this instance, wrapped critical operations within `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully, preventing any unwanted termination that could lead to inconsistency or data leaks. For actual security best practices like ensuring data encryption or managing sensitive information securely, more context about the data and user operations would be needed.
    
6. **Performance and Scalability**:
    - By eliminating the redundant creation and invocation of resources, this version avoids unnecessary computation and memory usage, thus slightly optimizing performance. For scalability concerns, ensuring that each module like `DataHandler` and `UserManager` act independently can make scaling out the application easier.

These changes ensure the application adheres better to the principles of robust and maintainable software design as outlined by SOLID and general coding best practices.
