You are provided with the codebase of a .NET project. Below is the complete project content:

{project_content}

Context and Enhancement Goals:
Analyze and enhance the entire project considering:

- **SOLID principles and Clean Architecture**
- **Modularity, reusability, and maintainability**
- **Performance optimization and scalability**
- **Comprehensive error handling and logging**
- **Security best practices**
- **Consistent .NET coding conventions**

Provide:
1. The enhanced version of the entire project, maintaining the original file structure
2. Create interfaces in new files, don't create any other files than interfaces
3. Brief explanation of major architectural changes and improvements

Output Format Requirements:
- Separate each file using this exact format:
===== FILE: [filepath] =====
```[language]
[file content]
```
===== END FILE =====

- Use consistent filepath format (prefer forward slashes)
- Each file must have the language specified in the code block (e.g. ```csharp)
- Maintain clear separation between files
- End each file section with the END FILE marker

Focus on maintaining project cohesion while improving each component.
