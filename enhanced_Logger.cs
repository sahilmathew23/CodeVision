Here's the enhanced version of `Logger.cs`, featuring several improvements that align with the specified goals:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

namespace LoggingService
{
    public interface ILogger
    {
        void LogMessage(string message);
    }

    public class Logger : ILogger
    {
        private readonly string _logFilePath;

        public Logger(string logFilePath = "log.txt")
        {
            _logFilePath = logFilePath;
        }

        public void LogMessage(string message)
        {
            try
            {
                using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(_logFilePath, append: true))
                {
                    writer.WriteLine($"{DateTime.UtcNow}: {message}");
                }
            }
            catch (IOException ex)
            {
                Console.Error.WriteLine("Error writing to log file: " + ex.Message);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.Error.WriteLine("An unexpected error occurred: " + ex.Message);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Modifications:**

1. **Interface Implementation (`ILogger`)**:
   - **SOLID Compliance**: Adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle of SOLID, `ILogger` interface is introduced to decouple higher-level components from lower-level details of logger implementation, which enhances modularity and facilitates unit testing.

2. **Constructor with File Path Parameter**:
   - **Flexibility**: Allows specification of different log file paths, improving modularity and reusability by not hardcoding the file path, which is a better practice for scalability and maintainability.

3. **Using statement**:
   - **Resource Management**: Ensures that the `StreamWriter` is correctly disposed of, eliminating resource leaks which were present in the original code.

4. **Exception Handling**:
   - **Robustness**: Catches both `IOException` and a general `Exception` to handle file-related errors and other unexpected errors respectively. Errors are logged to the console, providing traceability.

5. **Logging With Timestamp**:
   - **Traceability**: Prefixing messages with `DateTime.UtcNow` to ensure each log entry is timestamped, aiding in debugging and log analysis.

6. **Security & Best Practices**:
   - **Append Mode**: Opens the log file in append mode to prevent overwriting existing logs which ensures that log data is preserved (important for auditing and troubleshooting).
   - **Parameter Path**: By allowing the path to be specified, this code respects environments where the default write paths might be restricted, thus adhering to the security best practices concerning file I/O.

7. **Performance and Scalability**: 
   - Opening and closing the file each time `LogMessage` is called can be expensive especially with numerous log entries. In a highly scalable scenario, considering a log server or asynchronous logging mechanism might be more appropriate if performance becomes a bottleneck. However, this implementation prioritizes simplicity and correctness, applicable for many standard use-cases.

This enhancement leads to a logger that is not only flexible but also reliable and easy to integrate or extend within larger applications, while providing necessary error management and security practices.
