Below is the revised version of `Logger.cs`, refactored and enhanced according to the required goals:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

namespace LoggingService
{
    public interface ILogger
    {
        void LogMessage(string message);
    }

    public class Logger : ILogger
    {
        private readonly string _filePath;

        public Logger(string filePath = "log.txt")
        {
            _filePath = filePath;
        }

        public void LogMessage(string message)
        {
            try
            {
                // Ensures that the file is always closed after writing, even if an error occurs
                // Uses FileStream with FileMode.Append to avoid overwriting the existing logs
                using (var stream = new FileStream(_filePath, FileMode.Append, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.Read))
                using (var writer = new StreamWriter(stream))
                {
                    writer.WriteLine($"Log Entry : {DateTime.Now}: {message}");
                }
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                // Real-world applications might log this to a secondary logging service or system event logs
                Console.Error.WriteLine($"Failed to write to log: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Modifications

**1. Implementation of ILogger Interface:**
   - **SOLID Principle (Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion):** By defining an `ILogger` interface, Logger now implements a logging contract, which makes it easier to replace, test, or extend without altering the dependent classes. It segregates the logging functionality (single responsibility) and encourages dependency on abstractions not concrete implementations.

**2. Constructor Dependency Injection:**
   - **Flexibility and Testing:** Allows the file path for logs to be injected at runtime, which increases flexibility and eases unit testing. It adheres to the Dependency Inversion principle by allowing the dependency to be injected rather than tightly coupling the class to a specific log file path.

**3. Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - **Robustness:** By wrapping the I/O operations within a try-catch block, the application is protected against exceptions during logging, ensuring the main application workflow is not impacted by logger failures.

**4. Use of `using` Statement:**
   - **Resource Management:** Automatically handles closing the StreamWriter and FileStream, even in cases of exceptions, which avoids memory leaks and file handle issues.

**5. Thread Safety Consideration in File Access:**
   - **Concurrency:** The `FileShare.Read` ensures that other processes can read the file while it's being written to, but not write to it concurrently, which may prevent some types of file access conflicts.

**6. Adding Timestamps to Logs:**
   - **Traceability:** Each log entry now includes a timestamp which is crucial for diagnosing issues in a production environment by providing context regarding when each event happened.

**7. Enforcing .NET Coding Conventions:**
   - **Readability and Maintainability:** Consistent use of braces, naming conventions, and member access modifiers (`private`) follow .NET best practices making the code more readable and maintainable.

### Security Best Practices and Performance Considerations:
- This improved logger does not address data sanitization or encryption for log files which might be required depending on the sensitivity of logs.
- For large-scale applications, consider asynchronous logging mechanisms to avoid blocking the main application thread, or use established logging frameworks like NLog, Serilog, or log4net which offer advanced features optimized for performance and scalability.
